# chess-website
This app is my implementation of chess GUI from scratch. The game itself is written in pure JS.
You can play with yourself or with Stockfish (open source chess engine). There is also position editor which allows you to start game from some custom position.
If you want to run this app locally, you need to have Node.js and Express.js installed.
Starting server:
```
node server.js
```
